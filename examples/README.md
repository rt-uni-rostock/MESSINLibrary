# Examples


## [InterfaceToUSV](InterfaceToUSV/)
This example shows how to send a command message to the MESSIN interface IPC and how to receive a state message from the MESSIN interface IPC.
The actual interface blocks for UDP transmission and reception are not implemented as they would depend on the host operating system and/or third-party libraries.
